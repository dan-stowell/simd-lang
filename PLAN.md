# PLAN

The campaign is chosen by the user. Sessions **do not edit** the Campaign, Exit test, Kill
test or Rules sections; they append to Milestones and keep the Now line current. A session
cannot switch campaigns. If you think the campaign is wrong, write the evidence in STATUS.md
under "Decisions for Dan" and keep working on it.

## Campaign 1 (from 2026-11-12): our own compiler for whole packages, fused

The stock-compiler path is **frozen** at its 2026-11-12 result: MinIO cold 11.2 s median,
kube-apiserver 19.8-21.3 s (configuration `13-noweakptr`; MORNING.md, TRACE.md). It is the
baseline to beat and the per-package fallback. No more work goes into making it faster.

Why this campaign: the 2026-11-12 CPU table says fusing the stock compiler's work removes at
most about 27 of 74 core-seconds; what is left (~47 core-s, 5.9 s on 8 cores) is the stock
compiler's own work. Two seconds needs the compiling itself to be about three times cheaper:
whole packages compiled without the stock front end, with no export-IR round trip, no
`obj.Prog` assembler path and no separate linker. `05-sbc` showed that taking single
functions does not pay; whole packages leaving the stock compiler is the seam that does.

How is yours to decide: whole-program type checking once in one address space (go/types or
your own), a lowering of your own, direct emission (the baseline generator's knowledge of
frames, stack maps, write barriers and the calling convention is reusable), and the F4 link
spike in `explore/f4link` as the place code lands. Stock fallback per package for anything
not yet handled.

**The trace may stay flat or get worse for days during this campaign.** That is expected and
not a reason to retreat. Progress is the oracle number below.

## Oracle number (moves hourly; report it at every milestone)

1. **Packages compiled entirely by our compiler, whose tests pass**: standard-library packages
   first (their own `go test` with the binary built our way, plus the differential suite
   against stock), then corpus packages (MinIO first). Report `N of M` per corpus project.
2. **Core-seconds per MB of source** on the packages we compile, next to the stock baseline
   mode's number on the same packages.

## Kill test (written before work began)

When the first 50 standard-library packages compile our way and pass, measure (2). If our
compiler costs more than **one third** of the stock baseline mode's core-seconds on the same
packages, with no measured path to one third, stop the campaign: write up why in JOURNAL.md
and STATUS.md, and ask for the next campaign under "Decisions for Dan". Only this measurement
ends the campaign early; time, usage and session ends never do.

## Exit test

A fresh cold MinIO build (CHARTER.md's cold rule) in **3.3 s wall or less on 8 cores** (an
order of magnitude under the fair stock row's 32.5 s), binary passing MinIO's tests, with
the corpus scoreboard showing the same technique on every corpus project.

## Rules

- Commit and push every working step, with tests for what it touches, so an abrupt end loses
  nothing.
- Use subagents as builders: split work into oracle-checked parts, one git worktree each.
- The 8-vCPU VM is the machine (decided by the user). Scaling is reported at 1, 2, 4 and 8 cores.

## Milestones

M0. **Corpus scoreboard** (bounded: one day at most; then back to the compiler even if parts are
    missing). Pin and fetch the corpus in CHARTER.md; one script builds each cold, stock and fair
    stock, at 1, 2, 4 and 8 cores, and records wall clock, critical path and core-seconds in
    `SCOREBOARD.md`. Bazel projects build from their Bazel DAG (`bazel aquery`), generated code
    included. Our column starts as "stock fallback" and fills in as the campaign lands.
M1. Our compiler compiles a first standard-library package end to end, linked into a binary that
    passes that package's tests.
M2. 50 standard-library packages: run the kill test.
M3. The whole standard library and runtime our way.
M4. MinIO entirely our way, passing its tests.
M5. No separate linker: code emitted into the image (F4).
M6. The exit test; the corpus scoreboard filled in.

Log (append one line per milestone reached, with the oracle number):

Now: Start M0: pin the corpus (CHARTER.md, Targets) and write the scoreboard script; then M1.
